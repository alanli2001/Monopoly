## Overview
### Description
Just like in classic Monopoly, users exchange money and claim properties in the fight to be the last man whoâ€™s not bankrupt. Each property on the default board is a location at Cornell with a corresponding color type, price, and rent.

### Features
- All features of classic Monopoly are supported.
- Users can design a board themselves and import it into the game in JSON format 
- Users can track the state of the game using our interactive GUI. They can move their player markers and add buildings to properties
